#notes on linear algebra
1. always have equations in mind, linear algebra in nature is a compact of linear equations $Ax = B$.
2. the usage of outer product to compact A whose columns are all equal to some vector $x \in R^n$
3. amazing! any matrix could be composed of a symetric and a anti-symetric matrices.
4. A norm of a vector ||x|| is informally a measure of the "length" of the vector.
5. the definition of the projection of one vector.
\[
Proj(y;{x_1,...,x_n}) = argmin_{v\in span(\{x_1,...,x_n\})}||y-v||_2
\]
