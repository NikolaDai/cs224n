#notes on linear algebra
we strongly recomment two online videos, one from MIT and the other from https://www.bilibili.com/video/av9406644/ and the other is https://www.bilibili.com/video/av6081149 .
1. always have equations in mind, linear algebra in nature is a compact of linear equations $Ax = B$.
2. the usage of outer product to compact A whose columns are all equal to some vector $x \in R^n$
3. amazing! any matrix could be composed of a symetric and a anti-symetric matrices.
4. A norm of a vector ||x|| is informally a measure of the "length" of the vector.
5. the definition of the projection of one vector.one more words on this last equation, it is closely related to principle components analysis (PCA). we should put more attention to understand.
\[
Proj(y;{x_1,...,x_n}) = argmin_{v\in span(\{x_1,...,x_n\})}||y-v||_2
\]
6. The span of a $set$ of vectors ${x_1,x_2,...,x_n}$ is the set of vectors that can be expressed as a linear combination of ${x_1,x_2,...,x_n}$.

#notes on probability
1. multiple random variables' probability is a must to know, for example, the chain rule and independence.

#notes on convex opitimization
