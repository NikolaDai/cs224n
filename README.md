# css224n
This course was started on Mar 18, 2019. The course guide is Bin Dai(www.icsi.berkeley.edu/~bdai). All the course materials are available on http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/index.html#schedule and video on https://www.bilibili.com/video/av46216519. Each group member is asked to follow the course github on https://github.com/NikolaDai/cs224n. Keep in mind that we are not only going through the lectures' video, but also all the related materials and papers. it needs time but pls be patient.
1. First Task due to Mar, 24.<br>
  * read the lecture's ppt(check out the vocabulary)
  * listen to the lecture
  * watch the lecture
2. Read the review of linear algebra due to Mar, 24.
  * try to understand the true meaning of the basic math knowledge
  * if hard to understand the english content, get help from corresponding chinese textbook.
3. Read Review of Probability Theory (review of probability theory)
  * probability is playing an essential role in deep learning and natural language Processing
  * keep in mind some important formula and notations.
4. Read the convex opitimization materials due to April, 5th.
  * mention least square, logistic regression and SVM, needs more time to digest.
  * some contents connect back to the linear algebra material, go back and review, such as positive semidefinite matrax.
5. Read the SVG material on April, 6th.
6. Watch the lecture 02 on April, 7th.
7. Read the material of http://mccormickml.com/2016/04/19/word2vec-tutorial-the-skip-gram-model/
  * this material indeed includes two parts, please go through both of them.
8. today's task is  a little bit far away from the cs224n just for the ones who are unfamilar with the basic mechanism of machine learning like MLP.the english veriosn is on http://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/mlp.html
for the one who is unhappy with english the chinese version is online https://github.com/exacity/deeplearningbook-chinese
  * we are going to read the sixth chapter of deeplearning.
9. finish reading the material (chinese version) written by peghoty(peghoty@163.com) word2vec中的数学 due to Mar, 21th.
  *based on my own reading experience, understanding the content of this material will be very helpful for u to understandt the word2vec and the contents of the lectures.
10. finish the assignment1
  *need to be familiar with numpy

# 本课程开始前要求学生具备以下知识储备

1. 熟练掌握Python

所有的类分配都将使用Python(使用NumPy和PyTorch)。如果您需要提醒自己使用Python，或者您不太熟悉NumPy，您可以参加第1周的Python复习会议(在日程安排中列出)。如果你有很多编程经验，但是使用不同的语言(如C/ c++ /Matlab/Java/Javascript)，你可能会很好。

2. 掌握大学微积分，线性代数

您应该熟悉(多变量)导数，理解矩阵/向量表示法和运算。

3. 基本概率及统计(例如cs109或同等学历)

你应该了解概率、高斯分布、均值、标准差等基本知识。

4. 机器学习基础(例如CS 221或CS 229)

我们将制定cost函数，求导和梯度下降进行优化。如果你已经有基本的机器学习和/或深入的学习知识，课程将会更容易;但是，没有它也可以使用CS224n。有许多介绍ML的网页，书籍和视频形式。哈尔•道姆(Hal Daume)正在进行的机器学习课程是一个很容易上手的介绍。阅读那本书的前5章将是一个很好的背景。知道前7章会更好!
