8. today's task is  a little bit far away from the cs224n just for the ones who are unfamilar with the basic mechanism of machine learning like MLP.the english veriosn is on http://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/mlp.html
for the one who is unhappy with english the chinese version is online https://github.com/exacity/deeplearningbook-chinese
  * we are going to read the sixth chapter of deeplearning.
9. finish reading the material (chinese version) written by peghoty(peghoty@163.com) word2vec中的数学 due to Mar, 21th.
  *based on my own reading experience, understanding the content of this material will be very helpful for u to understandt the word2vec and the contents of the lectures.
